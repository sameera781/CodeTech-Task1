Project Overview: File Handling Demo
This project demonstrates basic file handling operations in Java using the java.io package. It provides a simple console-based menu-driven interface to perform the following file operations on a text file (example.txt):

1. Features
Write to File:

Appends user-provided text to the file.
Ensures that the existing content in the file is preserved.
Utilizes BufferedWriter with FileWriter in append mode.
Read from File:

Reads and displays the contents of the file line by line.
Ensures that file contents are presented clearly to the user.
Uses BufferedReader for efficient line-by-line reading.
Modify File:

Allows the user to replace specific text in the file with new text.
Reads the file content into memory, performs string replacements, and writes the updated content back to the file.
Ensures no loss of content while modifying.
Exit:

Exits the application cleanly by closing the Scanner resource.
2. Code Highlights
Error Handling:

Comprehensive try-catch blocks for handling file-related exceptions (IOException).
Prevents runtime crashes by validating the existence of the file during modifications.
User Input Handling:

Handles user choices robustly with a switch statement.
Ensures proper newline consumption using scanner.nextLine() after scanner.nextInt().
Text Replacement:

Implements a flexible mechanism to search and replace text in the file content.
Maintains file formatting by using System.lineSeparator() during rewriting.
3. Practical Applications
Learning Tool:
Helps beginners understand file handling concepts in Java.
Template:
Can be extended for more advanced file operations, like searching for specific patterns or handling different file formats.
Utility:
A quick tool for small-scale file edits and content viewing.
4. Areas for Enhancement
Validation:

Add input validation for numeric choices to prevent invalid inputs from causing exceptions.
Notify users if the file is empty during read operations.
File Selection:

Extend the program to allow dynamic file selection instead of a hardcoded file name.
Backup Mechanism:

Implement a backup feature before modifying the file to prevent accidental data loss.
Improved Modify Functionality:

Allow users to modify specific lines instead of performing global text replacement.
Cross-Platform File Path Handling:

Include support for different file path formats for compatibility across operating systems.
